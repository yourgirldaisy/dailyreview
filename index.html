          <h2 id=aboutme>About Me</h2>
              <p>My name is Daisy. I am fifteen years old. I was born on January 4, 2000. I was born in El Paso, TX. I have lived in Fresno, CA most of my life but lived in TN for three years. </p>
              <p>A place I would like to visit some someday is Paris. I would like to visit there to see the Eiffel Tower. I would also like to visit there because it's a big city. I love big cities. </p>
          <h2 id=goals>Goals</h2>
              <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
                  <p>One of my long term goals is to travel. I want to travel all around the world. I want to see the big cities and the hidden places. I want to see exotic scenes and the most normal.</p>
                  <p>Another long term goal is that I want to try things. I want to try foods that I normally eat. I want to try things people don’t normally do, like skydiving and bungee jumping. I want to experience. </p>
              <h3>Short Term Goals</h3>
                  <p>One of my short term goals is to finish high school. I want to finish high school proudly though. I want to finish high school knowing I did well. For example, getting good grades and put in effort. </p>
                  <p>Another short term goal is to make myself feel better. I want to do things that make me happy. Little things like getting better clothes or do my hair that get my self-esteem up. </p>
          <h2 id=accomplishments>Accomplishments</h2>
              <h3>Educational</h3>
                  <p>An educational accomplishment I’ve made is get good grades. I put effort into all my classes therefore I get A’s and B’s. Putting in effort helps you get where you want to be. </p>
              <h3>Personal</h3>
                  <p>A personal goal I’ve made is keeping positive. Keeping positive about any situation makes you feel better than if you try to be negative. Keeping positive has your self-esteem up rather than down. Being happy is good. </p>
